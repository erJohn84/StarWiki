# StarWiki

Welcome to StarWiki!!!

This is a SW wiki app that handles api requests to the SWApi site. It uses AlamoFire to make the requests. The UI is made in the most
simplest way, so everybody can use it.

The Api requests gets the data from https://swapi.co . It has more endpoints than i made available in the app... its a very cool site for
SW fans :)

This app basically is a tool for browsing Star Wars info. Sorry i didnt put a search bar, but definitely for the next commit will be there!

Any comments, look for me on twitter: @er_john

Enjoy!
